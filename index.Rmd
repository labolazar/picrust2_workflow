1. Installing PICRUST

This was already done and does not need to be done again. 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mamba create -n picrust2 -c bioconda -c conda-forge picrust2=2.5.2
``` 

2. Required input file 

The input files should be a FASTA of amplicon sequences variants (ASVs; i.e. your representative sequences, not your raw reads) and a tab-delimited table with ASV ids as the first column and sample abundances as all subsequent columns.

Example of both files : 


3. Running the full pipeline 

Running picrust throught command line (not R)

1. Activate the environnement
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
mamba activate picrust2
```
