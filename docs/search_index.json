This step will be performed automatically unless this option is specified (added in v2.2.0-b). --remove_intermediate - Remove the intermediate outfiles of the sequence placement and pathway inference steps. --verbose - If specified, print out wrapped commands to screen. See wiki for further options. Key output files EC_metagenome_out - Folder containing unstratified EC number metagenome predictions pred_metagenome_unstrat.tsv.gz sequence table normalized by predicted 16S copy number abundances (seqtab_norm.tsv.gz), and the per-sample NSTI values weighted by the abundance of each ASV (weighted_nsti.tsv.gz). KO_metagenome_out - As EC_metagenome_out above, but for KO metagenomes. pathways_out - Folder containing predicted pathway abundances and coverages per-sample, based on predicted EC number abundances.
