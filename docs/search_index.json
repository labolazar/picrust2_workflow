[["index.html", "Scripts from the Lazar Lab 1 Introduction", " Scripts from the Lazar Lab 1 Introduction This guide is a collection of diverse scripts produced by members of the Lazar Lab to analyze data from amplicon sequencing. The scripts assumes that the raw reads were previously proccessed through the DADA2 pipeline and the users have the following : Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) abundance table Taxonomy table Sample metadata table For any questions or comments please email : karine.villeneuve12@gmail.com Enjoy and happy data analysis !

It is recommended that users use the mamba package, which is a reimplementation of conda in C++, which typically increases the installation time substantially (the default conda can sometimes get stuck solving environments for hours at a time, which is a problem facing conda environments in general). The following code installs PICRUST2 using mamba: mamba create -n picrust2 -c bioconda -c conda-forge picrust2=2.5.2 2.2 Required input files FASTA of amplicon sequences variants (ASVs; i.e.Â your representative sequences, not your raw reads) Tab-delimited table with ASV ids as the first column and sample abundances as all subsequent columns Example of both files : 2.3 Running full PICRUST2 pipeline Activate the environnement mamba activate picrust2 Run the full default pipeline picrust2_pipeline.py -s fasta_file.fna -i asv_file.tsv -o picrust2_out -p 12 Main options : -s PATH - FASTA of unaligned study sequences -i PATH - Input table of sequence abundances (BIOM, TSV, or mothur shared file format) -o PATH - Output folder -p INT: Number of processes to run in parallel. --skip_norm - Skip normalizing sequence abundances by predicted marker gene copy numbers (typically 16S rRNA genes). This step will be performed automatically unless this option is specified (added in v2.2.0-b). --remove_intermediate - Remove the intermediate outfiles of the sequence placement and pathway inference steps. --verbose - If specified, print out wrapped commands to screen. See wiki for further options. 2.4 Key output files EC_metagenome_out - Folder containing unstratified EC number metagenome predictions pred_metagenome_unstrat.tsv.gz sequence table normalized by predicted 16S copy number abundances (seqtab_norm.tsv.gz), and the per-sample NSTI values weighted by the abundance of each ASV (weighted_nsti.tsv.gz). KO_metagenome_out - As EC_metagenome_out above, but for KO metagenomes. pathways_out - Folder containing predicted pathway abundances and coverages per-sample, based on predicted EC number abundances.
